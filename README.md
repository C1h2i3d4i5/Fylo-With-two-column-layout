## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/) - Icon Library


### What I learned

I used this challenge as an avenue to einforce what I already know about html and css. I am particularly fond of using the container + row classes to make mobile first workflow easier.

```css
.container{
  margin-left: 70px;
  margin-right: 70px;
}
.row{
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
}
```
Using these two is a real help in achieving a mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I will attempt more challenges to improve my skills
